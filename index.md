## Favorite CPSC120L labs

* Lab 4, Part 2

    This lab exercise was memorable and one of my favorites to do because I felt like I was being a great navigator for my partner and it focused on using if statements to play a high low game. Helping teach my partner why this coding exercise worked the way it did was honestly fun. Talking about how if statements worked helped my partner understand programming better. It made me more motivated to continue learning in this course!

* Lab 8, Part 1

    I picked Lab 8 to be one of my favorite labs because I was a pilot for a part of the exercise, and this exercise helped me understand the command line argument concepts by incorporating it into calculating an average mean. The real struggle was piecing it together with the already established if statements and for loops. One of my partners became a big help in explaining how it all worked. With my partner’s help and this exercise, it made me understand command line arguments better.

* Lab 11, Part 1

    The reason why I picked this lab is because I found object-oriented classes to be the most difficult part of the semester’s labs, but I feel overcoming that difficulty made me a better coder. This exercise focused on using an object oriented class by writing out the class’ member functions. I was able to help navigate my partner as well as I could. Although classes are kind of difficult to do, navigating my partner through the parts I did know how to solve made it engaging. I also enjoyed learning about classes more with the hands-on exercise.
